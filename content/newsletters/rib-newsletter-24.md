Welcome to the #24 edition of Rust in Blockchain,
the chillest newsletter about the chillest tech.
[Previous: #23](/newsletters/rewriting-in-rust/)

This month we're interested in cross-chain bridges.
With Ethereum at capacity recently,
other blockchain projects are eyeing the window
of opportunity between now and a functional Ethereum 2
to siphon away some of that chain's activity.
So there seems to be a rush to get bridges built
between Ethereum and every other chain,
not to mention between pairs of non-Ethereum chains.
It looks like we are well on our way to an internetwork of blockchains,
so now is a good time to do a survey of bridges
to Rust chains.

These bridges mostly support moving fungible tokens today,
and some plan to support NFTs;
contrasting with general cross-chain communications
protocols like [IBC] and [XCMP].

While the details differ between bridges and chains,
it seems that many of these bridges are their own distributed networks,
with similar behavior:

- They operate a network of validators.
- They maintain custodial contracts on each chain.
- Multisig cryptography is used by the validators to agree on
  pairs of cross-chain transactions.
- The bridge network may offer cryptoeconomic incentives for node operators.
- Watchdog nodes may monitor the network for misbehavior.
- Some of these networks are themselves blockchains,
  but many are not.

For a more informed description of bridges see
[this recent blog post from Patrick McCorry][bblog].

[bblog]: https://stonecoldpat.medium.com/a-note-on-bridges-layer-2-protocols-b01f8fc22324

Some of those in the Rust world include

- [Secret · Ethereum Bridge][seb]. Between Secret Network and Ethereum.
  Mainnet.
- [Secret · Monero Bridge][smb]. Between Secret Network and Monero.
  Testnet.
  - This is particularly interesting because there are relatively few
  on/off-ramps for privacy-preserving Monero, and this is a bridge
  to another privacy chain.
- [Secret · Binance Smart Chain Bridge][sbb]. Between Secret Network and Binance Smart Chain.
  Testnet.
- [Secret · Plasm Bridge][spb]. Between Secret Network and [Plasm Network].
  Not live.
  - This one will link Secret Network to the world of Polkadot parachains,
  and to to the world of [Cosmos]/[IBC]-based chains,
  as Plasm is a Substrate chain that is intended to connect to both.
- [Near · Rainbow Bridge][nrb]. Between Near and Ethereum.
  Mainnet.
- [Solana · Wormhole][swh]. Between Solana and Ethereum.
  Mainnet.
- [Nervos · Force-Bridge][nfb]. Between Nervos CKB and Ethereum.
  Testnet.
- [Polkadot · PolkaBTC][pi]. Between Polkadot and Bitcoin.
- [Polkadot · Snowbridge][psb]. Between Polkadot and Ethereum.
  Not live.
- [Polkadot · Darwinia][pd]. Between Polkadot and Ethereum.
- [Polkadot · ChainBridge][pcb]. Between Polkadot and Ethereum.
- [Polkadot · Bifrost][pbf]. Between Polkadot and EOS.

Polkadot's family of bridges is [described here][pbridges].

## Project Spotlight

Each month we like to shine a light on a notable Rust blockchain project. This month that project is…

[TDN] (and [Chamomile]).

Trusted Distributed Network is a framework for building distributed applications,
with support for p2p communications, multiple cross-communicating blockchains,
multiple layers of blockchains, and multiple account models.
It is built on a new p2p library, Chamomile.

TDN appears to be somewhat comparable to Substrate,
and Chamomile to libp2p.

Chamomile adds to the choices available to Rust developers
for p2p networking, which already include [rust-libp2p], and [tentacle].

These projects are authored by
[@sunhauchuang]
who also created
[Awesome Rust Blockchain][arb].
