Thank you for your help!

RiB needs help to keep up with Rust blockchain projects. 
If you follow a particular project, or otherwise find information 
that is beneficial to the Rust & blockchain community, 
please contribute to the next issue
by submitting a PR to the [next draft](https://github.com/rust-in-blockchain/Rust-in-Blockchain/tree/master/draft).

## Project Spotlight

Each month we like to shine a light on a notable Rust blockchain
project. This month that project is…

[jsonrpsee].

This is an async implementation of [JSON-RPC],
from Parity,
who also created the popular [jsonrpc] crate.
