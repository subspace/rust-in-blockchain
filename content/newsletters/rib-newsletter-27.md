Welcome to the #27 edition of Rust in Blockchain,
the chillest newsletter about the chillest tech.
[Previous: #26](/newsletters/rib-newsletter-26/).

It was a slow month, with few project updates, and few new projects.

Thank you for your help!

RiB needs help to keep up with Rust blockchain projects.  If you
follow a particular project, or otherwise find information that is
beneficial to the Rust & blockchain community, please contribute to
the next issue by submitting a PR to the [next
draft](https://github.com/rust-in-blockchain/Rust-in-Blockchain/tree/master/draft).

## Project Spotlight

Each month we like to shine a light on a notable Rust blockchain
project. This month that project is…

[Stateright](https://github.com/stateright/stateright).

Stateright is a model checker for implementing distributed systems in Rust.
Unlike traditional model checkers like TLA+, Stateright is a Rust DSL,
and is able to check the Rust production implementation of a system.
It includes examples of Paxos and other simple algorithms.
