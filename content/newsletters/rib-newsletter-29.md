Welcome to the #29 edition of Rust in Blockchain, the monthly
newsletter about Rust, distributed systems, cryptography, and other
industry topics.
[Previous: #28](/newsletters/rib-newsletter-28/).

With [total value locked (TVL)][tvl] measurements going up, up, up across the
blockchain world, Ethereum extremely congested, and liquidity providers fleeing
to blockchains with high yields and low fees, there are huge efforts on many
chains to get dapps out fast and attract market share. In the Rust world some
notable developments:

- NEAR [launched an $800 million ecosystem fund][nf] and has been quietly
  climbing up the DeFi TVL charts.
- Secret Network can now bridge to multiple chains and its [SecretSwap] has enough
  liquidity that it will soon be a viable route for discreetly moving assets
  between the burgeoning multi-chain ecosystem.
- The Internet Computer (previously DFINITY) has been cranking out [blog posts][dfb],
  both about technical matters and partnerships. They are running a developer
  grants program.
- Nervos has [launched their Force Bridge][fb] to connect to Ethereum, and is
  working to add [EVM compatibility][nevm].
- Polkadot has been running a high-profile [auction for parachain slots][ps] on
  its canary network, Kusama, and will soon begin auctions for the main Polkadot
  network. Some of the Kusama parachains, notably [Moonriver], are already up
  and running and attracting EVM-compatible dapps like Sushi.
- Solana has turned into a bit of a juggernaut, with huge financial backing, and
  TVL only behind Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain. It has been attracting dapps
  and protocols that were previously EVM-only, like [Lido] and [RenVM]; but it
  also has a strong stable of its own Solana-native dapps.

In RiB news, this month we've added a "Security Advisories" section, summarizing
all the Rust security advisories of the month from [RustSec], and [GitHub
Advisories]. Seeing them all in one place is revealing: lots of
security-relevant bugs in crates used in, or created by, the blockchain
industry.

This month, [upon prompting][zcp], we added a Zcash donation address, and
immediately received 3 donations. Thanks to the Zcash twitter community! RiB
donations are 100% earmarked for supporting developers through event
sponsorships, etc. The donation addresses can be found on the sidebar of
[the website][ribweb].

## Project Spotlight

Each month we like to shine a light on a notable Rust blockchain project. This month that project is…

[mina-rs].

[Mina] is a new blockchain network that uses zero-knowledge proofs to validate
the state of the chain without access to a full blockchain, but instead only a
tiny (~22k) proof. This should enable even mobile devices to participate in the
network as full validators, requiring less trust than today's situation where
most clients are connecting to other peoples' full nodes hosted in the cloud.
They are calling this style of chain a "succinct blockchain", and have caught
the attention of a number of other projects, forming partnerships to bring the
idea to other chains.

[mina-rs] is an implementation of Mina in Rust, developed by [ChainSafe]. It is
developed not only with mobile environments in mind, but WASM too, which
suggests we'll be able to embed a full node directly in the browser.

## Security Advisories

Monthly security advisories, from [RustSec], and [GitHub Advisories].
Bold entries here are especially relevant to blockchain projects.

[RustSec]: https://rustsec.org/advisories/
[GitHub Advisories]: https://github.com/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust

- [RUSTSEC-2021-0120: Unsoundness in abomonation](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2021-0120.html).
  abomonation transmutes &T to and from &[u8] without sufficient constraints.
- **[RUSTSEC-2021-0121: Unsoundness in crypto2](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2021-0121.html).**
  Non-aligned u32 read in Chacha20 encryption and decryption.
- [CVE-2021-20319: coreos installer improperly verifies GPG signature when decompressing gzipped artifact](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3r3g-g73x-g593).
  coreos-installer fails to correctly verify GPG signatures when decompressing
  gzip-compressed artifacts. This allows bypass of signature verification in
  cases where coreos-installer decompresses a downloaded OS image, allowing an
  attacker who can modify the OS image to compromise a newly-installed system.
- **[CVE-2020-26281: Async-h1 request smuggling possible with long unread bodies](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4vr9-8cjf-vf9c).**
  This vulnerability affects any webserver that uses async-h1 behind a reverse proxy, including all such Tide applications.
- **[CVE-2021-41138: Validity check missing in Frontier](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vj62-g63v-f8mf).**
  In the newly introduced signed Frontier-specific extrinsic for
  pallet-ethereum, a large part of transaction validation logic was only called
  in transaction pool validation, but not in block execution. Malicious
  validators can take advantage of this to put invalid transactions into a
  block.
- [CVE-2021-41149: Improper sanitization of target names](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-x3r5-q6mj-m485).
  The tough library, prior to 0.12.0, does not properly sanitize target names
  when caching a repository, or when saving specific targets to an output
  directory. When targets are cached or saved, files could be overwritten with
  arbitrary content anywhere on the system.
- [CVE-2021-41150: Improper sanitization of delegated role names](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-r56q-vv3c-6g9c).
  The tough library, prior to 0.12.0, does not properly sanitize delegated role
  names when caching a repository, or when loading a repository from the
  filesystem. When the repository is cached or loaded, files ending with the
  .json extension could be overwritten with role metadata anywhere on the
  system.
- **[CVE-2021-41153: Specification non-compliance in JUMPI](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pvh2-pj76-4m96).**
  In evm crate < 0.31.0, JUMPI opcode's condition is checked after the
  destination validity check. However, according to Geth and OpenEthereum, the
  condition check should happen before the destination validity check.
- **[GHSA-v935-pqmr-g8v9: Unexpected panics in num-bigint](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-v935-pqmr-g8v9).**
  Two scenarios were reported where BigInt and BigUint multiplication may unexpectedly panic.
