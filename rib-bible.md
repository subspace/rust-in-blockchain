# The Rust in Blockchain Bible

This document simply lists the places to look for content for editions of RIB.

Guidelines when looking for content:

- Topics on official blogs and tweets are probably important
- Look for interesting tags on PRs and issues
- Look for PRs and issues with many comments
- Sorting by most comments can help find important PRs

Note:
for the purposes of generating GitHub metrics,
repo information also must be duplicated
in [ribbot/src/rib-config.toml][config].
